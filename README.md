StateMachine Timer
===========
C++ library for providing millisecond-level timing on microcontrollers without blocking. Current version is somewhat specific to Arduino but can likely be easily modified to work with most microcontrollers.

The `examples` folder contains an example program demonstrating how the library is used. A more full featured example is included in the Neuroblinks source code [here](https://github.com/sheiney/neuroblinks/tree/master/private/firmware)

TODO: Use microsecond counter instead of millisecond counter to get better timing resolution (need way to deal with overflow).
