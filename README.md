StateMachine Timer
===========
C++ library for providing millisecond-level timing on microcontrollers without blocking. Current version is somewhat specific to Arduino but can likely be easily modified to work with most microcontrollers.

The `examples` folder contains an example program demonstrating how the library is used.

TODO: Use microsecond counter instead of millisecond counter to get better timing resolution.
